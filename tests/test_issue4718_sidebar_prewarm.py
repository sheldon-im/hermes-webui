"""Regression tests for #4718 — post-profile-switch sidebar pre-warm.

Measurement on v0.51.610 (@rodboev's CDP profiling) showed the dominant remaining
cold-switch cost is the `/api/sessions` payload build (~780ms), paid by the client's
sidebar GET that lands right after `POST /api/profile/switch` returns (~200ms). The
gateway-watcher stop() join — the original Phase-2 suspect — is ~0.4ms and not the
bottleneck. And #4769's `sidebar_source=webui` path means the sidebar no longer calls
`get_cli_sessions()` at all, so the relevant cache is the `_session_list_cache` layer
(`_get_cached_session_list_payload`), not the lower CLI-sessions cache.

`warm_session_list_cache()` therefore warms the SAME `_session_list_cache` the sidebar
reads, mirroring the GET handler's key + builder, so the post-switch GET hits warm.
These tests pin that behavior.
